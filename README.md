**A coordination protocol for AI agents that work together without talking to each other.**

---

## The Problem

In 2026, OpenAI reported that its RL-trained eval agents — given shared access to a package server — started using it as a message board, leaving notes for each other and later exploiting it. The drive to coordinate through shared writable surfaces is *trained into* modern agents, not prompted into them. SBP is that surface, built on purpose — with limits, logging, and an off switch.

Ants don't hold meetings. They don't send messages to specific ants. They leave **pheromone trails** in the environment, and other ants sense those trails and react. No coordinator. No routing. No address book. The colony self-organizes.

**SBP brings this pattern to software** — with two complementary layers:

1. **Pheromones** — Ephemeral signals with intensity that decay over time. Perfect for real-time coordination.
2. **Traces** — Durable knowledge records that persist until explicitly erased. Perfect for institutional memory.

Agents deposit signals, sense the environment, and respond when conditions are met. Coordination emerges from the environment, not from explicit wiring.

### Ten Operations

| Operation | Layer | What it does |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Emit** | Pheromone | Deposit a signal (intensity + decay + payload) |
| **Sniff** | Pheromone | Read the current environmental state |
| **Register Scent** | Both | Declare "wake me up when these conditions are true" |
| **Trigger** | Both | Blackboard activates a dormant agent |
| **Deregister Scent** | Both | Remove a trigger condition |
| **Evaporate** | Pheromone | Administrative: expire pheromones below the evaporation threshold |
| **Inspect** | Pheromone | Dump full blackboard state (pheromones, traces, scents) for debugging |
| **Inscribe** | Trace | Create or update a durable knowledge record |
| **Read** | Trace | Query traces by trail, key, prefix, or tags |
| **Erase** | Trace | Remove traces matching criteria |

### Key Concepts

- **Pheromones** have intensity (0.0–1.0) that decays over time. Strong signals demand attention; weak ones are background noise. Unreinforced data evaporates automatically.
- **Traces** are versioned knowledge records addressed by `trail + key`. They never decay — use them for configuration, learned knowledge, audit trails, and institutional memory.
- **Trails** are shared namespaces (e.g., `market.signals`, `config`) that organize both pheromones and traces.
- **Scent conditions** are threshold rules that can combine both layers. An agent says "trigger me when volatility ≥ 0.7 AND risk-config exists" and then goes dormant — costing nothing — until the environment wakes it.
- **Merge strategies** control what happens when you emit a pheromone that already exists — reinforce it, replace it, take the max, or add intensities.

## Where SBP Fits: Alongside MCP and A2A, Not Instead of Them

If you're building with AI agents, you've probably seen [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — the standard for **agent → tool** interactions. You may also have seen [A2A (Agent2Agent)](https://a2a-protocol.org/) — the standard for agents that *do* know each other and communicate directly, delegating tasks and streaming results back.

SBP answers a question neither addresses: **how do agents coordinate when they don't know each other exist?** No routing, no address book — a shared environment they all read and write.

| | MCP | A2A | SBP |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What it solves** | How an agent uses tools | How agents delegate to each other | How agents coordinate together |
| **Interaction** | Direct: "agent calls tool" | Direct: "agent talks to agent" | Indirect: "agent senses environment" |
| **Coupling** | Agent knows the tool it's calling | Agents know each other's identity | Agents don't know each other exist |
| **Pattern** | Request → Response | Task → Updates → Result | Emit → Sense → React |
| **State** | Sessions between agent and server | Task state between the two agents | Shared environmental state |
| **Memory** | External to protocol | Private to each agent | Built-in (Traces for durable, Pheromones for ephemeral) |

**All three are complementary.** Use MCP for tool invocation, A2A for direct agent-to-agent workflows, and SBP for coordination through a shared environment — they compose in the same system.

## Honest Limits

SBP gives agents a shared writable surface. Board **data** can't execute anything — a pheromone payload is inert JSON — but the board **does wake LLMs**: a fired trigger is a real agent activation, and an LLM acting on attacker-controlled context is a real risk surface. Safety comes from the worker's permission layer (`allowed_trails`, scent ownership, `freeze`) and the operation journal (observability and forensics), not from the board being inert.

**What is enforced:**

- **Trail permissions** — a worker's `allowed_trails` gates which trails it can read, write, or evaporate.
- **Scent ownership** — registrations are auto-prefixed with `{agent_id}:`; registering or deregistering under a foreign prefix is rejected.
- **Pheromone decay** — nothing lingers forever by default; unreinforced signals evaporate.
- **Append-only operation journal** — every operation, including reads, is logged with who, what, when, and outcome; `erase` writes a tombstone instead of deleting history.
- **Operator freeze switch** — `freeze(prefix)` immediately stops a misbehaving agent's triggers from firing or registering new ones.

**What is not solved:**

- **Prompt injection.** Untrusted-data labeling makes injected payloads visible and traceable through the journal — it does **not** prevent an LLM from being manipulated by text in its context.
- **Agent identity and authentication.** Any agent claiming an ID can act as that ID; nothing cryptographically verifies who is really making a call.
- **Multi-tenant isolation.** One blackboard is one trust boundary — this is not a multi-tenant system.
- **Secure webhook delivery.** Trigger delivery to `agent_endpoint` URLs is unauthenticated HTTP — see the warning in [SPECIFICATION.md](./SPECIFICATION.md).

## Installation

### Node.js

```bash
# Server
npm install @advicenxt/sbp-server

# Client
npm install @advicenxt/sbp-client

# Types (Shared definitions)
npm install @advicenxt/sbp-types
```

### Python

```bash
pip install sbp-client
```

## Quick Start

### Start the Server

```bash
cd packages/server && npm install
npm run dev
# → Listening on http://localhost:3000
```

### Python SDK

```bash
cd packages/client-python && pip install -e .
```

```python
from sbp import SbpClient

with SbpClient() as client:
    # Emit a real-time signal (ephemeral)
    client.emit("signals", "event", 0.8, payload={"source": "sensor-1"})

    # Inscribe durable knowledge (persistent)
    client.inscribe("config", "risk-tolerance", {"level": "moderate", "max_drawdown": 0.15})

    # Sense the environment
    result = client.sniff(trails=["signals"])
    for p in result.pheromones:
        print(f"{p.trail}/{p.type}: {p.current_intensity:.2f}")

    # Read traces
    traces = client.read(trails=["config"])
    for t in traces.traces:
        print(f"{t.trail}/{t.key} v{t.version}: {t.value}")
```

### Build a Reactive Agent

```python
from sbp import SbpAgent, run_agent
from sbp.conditions import threshold, trace_exists, and_

agent = SbpAgent("risk-monitor")

# Trigger on real-time signal
@agent.when("tasks", "new_task", operator=">=", value=0.5)
async def handle_task(trigger):
    print(f"Task received: {trigger.context_pheromones}")
    await agent.emit("tasks", "completed", 1.0)

# Cross-layer trigger: pheromone intensity + trace existence
@agent.on_scent("risk-alert",
    condition=and_(
        threshold("market", "volatility", ">=", 0.7),
        trace_exists("config", "risk-tolerance"),
    ),
)
async def handle_risk(trigger):
    # Read the config trace for context
    config = await agent.read(trails=["config"], keys=["risk-tolerance"])
    print(f"Risk alert! Config: {config.traces[0].value}")

run_agent(agent)
```

### Local Mode (No Server)

```python
from sbp import SbpClient

with SbpClient(local=True) as client:
    client.emit("local.test", "signal", 0.9)
    client.inscribe("local.config", "setting", {"debug": True})
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Autonomous Research Teams
An MCP-powered research agent uses tools to search the web. When it finds something important, it **emits a pheromone** and **inscribes a trace** with the raw findings. A synthesis agent, sensing a critical mass of research signals, wakes up, reads the traces for context, and compiles a report. No orchestrator scheduled any of this.

### 2. Self-Healing Infrastructure
Monitoring agents emit pheromones when they detect degradation. If the signal persists (multiple agents reinforcing the same pheromone), a remediation agent is triggered. Transient blips evaporate harmlessly because pheromones decay. Post-incident, traces record what happened for institutional memory.

### 3. Financial Signal Processing
A volatility agent emits pheromones proportional to detected volatility. An order agent does the same for large trades. A crisis handler has a **cross-layer condition**: "volatility ≥ 0.7 AND risk-config trace EXISTS." When both conditions are met, the handler wakes up, reads the risk configuration trace, and acts accordingly.

### 4. Multi-Agent Task Coordination
Worker agents emit completion pheromones. An aggregator senses "5+ stage-1 completions" and begins stage 2. Traces record the pipeline's institutional knowledge — what worked, what failed, what to try next time.

## Design Principles

1. **Stale-by-Default** — All pheromones decay. Unreinforced data evaporates automatically.
2. **Durable When Needed** — Traces persist for institutional memory. Two timescales, one environment.
3. **Sense, Don't Poll** — Agents declare interest patterns; the environment triggers them.
4. **Dormant by Default** — Agents hold no state between activations and cost nothing while waiting. Dormancy is a cost property, not a safety property — a fired trigger is a real agent activation.
5. **Intensity Over Boolean** — Signals have continuous strength, enabling nuanced responses.
