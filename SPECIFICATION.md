# Stigmergic Blackboard Protocol (SBP)

**Version:** 0.2.0
**Status:** Draft Specification
**Date:** 2026-04-23

---

## Abstract

The Stigmergic Blackboard Protocol (SBP) defines a standard for environment-based coordination between autonomous agents. Instead of direct agent-to-agent messaging, agents interact through a shared digital environment using two complementary layers:

1. **Digital Pheromones** — Ephemeral data signals with intensity and natural decay for real-time coordination.
2. **Traces** — Durable knowledge records for institutional memory that persist until explicitly erased.

SBP enables decoupled, self-organizing multi-agent systems where coordination emerges from environmental state rather than explicit orchestration.

### Conformance Keywords

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) and [RFC 8174](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174).

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Traditional multi-agent architectures rely on one of two patterns:

1. **Orchestration**: A central coordinator dispatches tasks to agents
2. **Choreography**: Agents communicate directly via message passing

Both patterns create coupling—agents must know about each other, handle message routing, and manage conversation state. This coupling increases complexity and reduces resilience.

**Stigmergy** offers an alternative. Derived from the Greek *stigma* (mark) and *ergon* (work), stigmergy describes indirect coordination through environmental modification. Ants coordinate colony behavior not by talking to each other, but by depositing pheromones that other ants sense.

SBP applies this biological pattern to digital agents.

### 1.2 Goals

- **Simplicity**: Minimal primitives, easy to implement
- **Decoupling**: Agents need no knowledge of each other
- **Self-Cleaning**: Stale data evaporates automatically
- **Emergent Coordination**: Complex behavior from simple rules
- **Interoperability**: Language and platform agnostic

### 1.3 Non-Goals

- Real-time streaming (use dedicated streaming protocols)
- Binary data transport (pheromones carry structured metadata only)
- Agent-to-agent direct messaging (use MCP or similar)

---

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Stale-by-Default

All signals MUST decay. If not reinforced, they evaporate to zero intensity. The environment is self-cleaning.

### 2.2 Sense, Don't Poll

Agents do not actively query the environment. They declare interest patterns, and the environment triggers them when conditions are met.

### 2.3 Stateless Agents

Agents are dormant by default. They SHOULD NOT carry persistent state between activations. All relevant context is encoded in the environmental signals that triggered them.

### 2.4 Intensity Over Boolean

Signals are not present/absent. They have continuous intensity. This enables nuanced responses: an agent might ignore a weak signal but respond urgently to a strong one.

### 2.5 Composition Through Thresholds

Complex coordination emerges from simple threshold rules combining multiple signal types.

## 4. Data Model

### 4.1 Pheromone Structure

A pheromone is the fundamental unit of data in SBP.

```typescript
interface Pheromone {
  // Identity
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier (UUID v7 RECOMMENDED)
  trail: string;                 // Namespaced category (e.g., "market.signals")
  type: string;                  // Signal type within trail (e.g., "volatility")

  // Temporal
  emitted_at: number;            // Unix timestamp (milliseconds)
  last_reinforced_at: number;    // Last reinforcement timestamp

  // Intensity & Decay
  initial_intensity: number;     // Starting intensity (MUST be 0.0 - 1.0 normalized)
  current_intensity: number;     // Computed current intensity after decay
  decay_model: DecayModel;       // How this pheromone decays

  // Content
  payload: object;               // Arbitrary JSON payload
  source_agent: string;          // Emitting agent identifier (OPTIONAL)

  // Metadata
  tags: string[];                // OPTIONAL classification tags
  ttl_floor: number;             // Minimum intensity before considered "evaporated"
}
```

### 4.2 Decay Models

SBP supports multiple decay models to match different signal semantics.

```typescript
type DecayModel =
  | { type: "exponential"; half_life_ms: number }
  | { type: "linear"; rate_per_ms: number }
  | { type: "step"; steps: StepDecay[] }
  | { type: "immortal" }  // Never decays (SHOULD be used sparingly)

interface StepDecay {
  at_ms: number;        // Time offset from emission
  intensity: number;    // Intensity at this step
}
```

**Exponential Decay** (Recommended Default):
```
intensity(t) = initial_intensity * (0.5 ^ (t / half_life))
```

**Linear Decay**:
```
intensity(t) = max(0, initial_intensity - (rate * t))
```

### 4.3 Computed Intensity

Current intensity MUST always be computed, never stored. This ensures:
- No background update processes needed
- Consistent reads regardless of when computed
- Trivial horizontal scaling

```typescript
function computeIntensity(pheromone: Pheromone, now: number): number {
  const elapsed = now - pheromone.last_reinforced_at;

  switch (pheromone.decay_model.type) {
    case "exponential":
      const halfLife = pheromone.decay_model.half_life_ms;
      return pheromone.initial_intensity * Math.pow(0.5, elapsed / halfLife);

    case "linear":
      const rate = pheromone.decay_model.rate_per_ms;
      return Math.max(0, pheromone.initial_intensity - (rate * elapsed));

    case "step":
      const steps = pheromone.decay_model.steps;
      for (let i = steps.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (elapsed >= steps[i].at_ms) {
          return Math.max(0, Math.min(steps[i].intensity, pheromone.initial_intensity));
        }
      }
      return pheromone.initial_intensity;

    case "immortal":
      return pheromone.initial_intensity;
  }
}
```

The computed intensity MUST NOT exceed the pheromone's `initial_intensity`; for
every decay model it MUST be clamped to `[0, initial_intensity]`.

### 4.4 Trail Structure

Trails organize pheromones into logical namespaces.

```typescript
interface Trail {
  name: string;                  // Fully qualified name (e.g., "market.signals")
  description: string;           // Human-readable description
  default_decay: DecayModel;     // Default decay for pheromones in this trail
  schema: JSONSchema;            // Payload schema for validation (optional)
  retention_policy: RetentionPolicy;
}

interface RetentionPolicy {
  evaporation_threshold: number; // Intensity below which pheromone is garbage collected
  max_pheromones: number;        // Maximum pheromones in trail (oldest evaporated first)
  archive_evaporated: boolean;   // Whether to archive evaporated pheromones
}
```

### 4.5 Trace Structure

A Trace is a durable knowledge record that persists until explicitly erased. Unlike pheromones, traces have no decay model.

```typescript
interface Trace {
  // Identity
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  trail: string;                 // Namespace (shared with pheromones)
  key: string;                   // Unique key within trail

  // Content
  value: object;                 // Arbitrary JSON payload (max 1 MB)

  // Temporal
  created_at: number;            // Unix timestamp (milliseconds)
  updated_at: number;            // Last modification timestamp
  version: number;               // Auto-incrementing version counter

  // Metadata
  source_agent?: string;         // Creating agent identifier (OPTIONAL)
  tags: string[];                // OPTIONAL classification tags
}
```

**Key properties:**

- **Composite uniqueness**: A trace is uniquely identified by the `trail + key` pair. Inscribing the same trail+key updates the existing trace.
- **No decay**: Traces persist indefinitely until explicitly erased via the ERASE operation.
- **Versioning**: Each update increments the `version` field, providing optimistic concurrency.
- **Size limit**: The `value` field MUST NOT exceed 1 MB (1,048,576 bytes) when serialized as JSON.

## 5. Protocol Operations

SBP defines a minimal set of operations. All operations SHOULD be idempotent where possible.

### 5.1 EMIT

Deposit a new pheromone or reinforce an existing one.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "method": "sbp/emit",
  "params": {
    "trail": "market.signals",
    "type": "volatility",
    "intensity": 0.8,
    "decay": { "type": "exponential", "half_life_ms": 300000 },
    "payload": {
      "symbol": "BTC-USD",
      "vix_equivalent": 45.2,
      "source": "volatility-analyzer"
    },
    "tags": ["crypto", "high-priority"],
    "merge_strategy": "reinforce"
  }
}
```

**Merge Strategies:**
- `"reinforce"`: If matching pheromone exists, boost intensity and reset decay timer
- `"replace"`: Replace existing pheromone entirely
- `"max"`: Take maximum of existing and new intensity
- `"add"`: Add intensities (capped at 1.0)
- `"new"`: Always create new pheromone (no merging)

**Matching for Merge:**
Pheromones MUST match if `trail + type + payload_hash` are identical.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "result": {
    "pheromone_id": "01945abc-def0-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
    "action": "reinforced",
    "previous_intensity": 0.3,
    "new_intensity": 0.8
  }
}
```

### 5.2 SNIFF

Sense the current environmental state. Unlike polling, SNIFF is a one-time read of matching signals.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "method": "sbp/sniff",
  "params": {
    "trails": ["market.signals", "market.orders"],
    "types": ["volatility", "large_order"],
    "min_intensity": 0.1,
    "tags": { "any": ["crypto"] },
    "limit": 100,
    "include_evaporated": false
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "result": {
    "timestamp": 1707350400000,
    "pheromones": [
      {
        "id": "01945abc-def0-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",

        "source_agent": "market-watcher",
        "age_ms": 120000
      }
    ],
    "aggregates": {
      "market.signals/volatility": {
        "count": 3,
        "sum_intensity": 1.45,

        "avg_intensity": 0.48
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5.3 REGISTER_SCENT

Declare a threshold condition that triggers agent activation. This is how agents "subscribe" without polling.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "method": "sbp/register_scent",
  "params": {
    "scent_id": "volatility-crisis-detector",
    "agent_endpoint": "https://agents.example.com/crisis-handler",

    "current_condition_state": {
      "met": false,
      "partial": {
        "market.signals/volatility >= 0.7": false,
        "market.orders/large_order count >= 5": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5.4 TRIGGER (Environment → Agent)

When a scent condition is met, the blackboard sends a trigger to the registered agent.

**Trigger Payload:**

    "scent_id": "volatility-crisis-detector",
    "triggered_at": 1707350400000,

      },
      "market.orders/large_order": {
        "count": 7,
        "triggering_pheromones": ["01945def-...", "01945ghi-..."]
      }
    },
    "context_pheromones": [

        "payload": { "symbol": "BTC-USD", "vix_equivalent": 45.2 },
        "source_agent": "market-watcher",
        "age_ms": 120000
      }
    ],

  "params": {
    "scent_id": "volatility-crisis-detector"
  }
}
```

### 5.6 EVAPORATE (Administrative)

Force immediate evaporation of pheromones matching criteria. This operation SHOULD be restricted to administrative agents.

**Request:**

  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "trace_id": "t-abc123",
  "action": "created",

}
```

The `action` field MUST be `"created"` for new traces or `"updated"` for existing ones.

Servers MAY require elevated API keys for INSCRIBE operations (see Section 11).

### 5.7 READ

Read traces matching filter criteria. All filter parameters are OPTIONAL; omitting all returns all traces.

**Request:**
```json

  }
}
```

}
```

Servers MAY require elevated API keys for ERASE operations (see Section 11).

## 6. Decay Mechanics

### 6.1 Time Resolution

All timestamps use Unix milliseconds (UTC). Implementations SHOULD use monotonic clocks where available for elapsed time calculations.

### 6.2 Reinforcement

When a pheromone is reinforced, the implementation MUST:
1. Update `last_reinforced_at` to the current time
2. Update `initial_intensity` to the new intensity
3. Reset the decay timer

This models biological pheromone behavior where repeated deposits strengthen a trail.

### 6.3 Evaporation Threshold

When `current_intensity` falls below the trail's `evaporation_threshold`, the pheromone MUST be considered evaporated. Evaporated pheromones:
- MUST be excluded from SNIFF results (unless `include_evaporated: true`)
- MUST NOT contribute to threshold conditions
- MAY be garbage collected or archived per retention policy

### 6.4 Recommended Defaults

| Use Case | Decay Model | Half-Life |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Real-time signals | Exponential | 30 seconds |
| Session data | Exponential | 5 minutes |
| Task coordination | Exponential | 30 minutes |
| Context preservation | Exponential | 4 hours |
| Historical markers | Step decay | Custom |

---

## 7. Threshold Triggers

### 7.1 Evaluation

The blackboard continuously evaluates registered scent conditions. Evaluation SHOULD occur:
- On every EMIT that could affect a registered condition
- Periodically (implementation-defined, recommended 100ms minimum)

Implementations MUST dispatch triggers for different scents concurrently; a slow or blocked
handler for one scent MUST NOT delay trigger delivery to another.

Implementations MUST allow at most one in-flight activation per scent: trigger evaluations that
occur while an activation for that scent is running MUST be counted as skipped, and the count MUST
be reported when the activation completes.

### 7.2 Cooldown

After triggering, a scent MUST enter cooldown for `cooldown_ms`. During cooldown:
- The scent MUST NOT be evaluated
- Additional triggers MUST be suppressed

This prevents trigger storms from rapidly fluctuating signals.

### 7.3 Aggregation Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `sum` | Sum of intensities of matching pheromones |
| `max` | Maximum intensity among matching pheromones |
| `avg` | Average intensity among matching pheromones |
| `count` | Number of matching pheromones above evaporation threshold |
| `any` | True if any matching pheromone exists (intensity > 0) |

### 7.4 Edge vs Level Triggering

SBP MUST use **edge triggering** by default: `trigger_mode` defaults to `edge_rising`, firing only when the condition crosses the threshold upward. Level triggering remains available via `"level"`: triggers fire when conditions become true; combined with cooldown, this provides predictable behavior. Level-mode scents default to `cooldown_ms` 1000 when unspecified; explicit `cooldown_ms=0` remains legal.

Edge-triggering configuration:
```json
{
  "trigger_mode": "edge_rising",  // Trigger only when crossing threshold upward
  "hysteresis": 0.1               // Must fall 0.1 below threshold before re-triggering
}
```

**Hysteresis.** `hysteresis` (default `0`; range 0–1 per the JSON schema) refines edge
triggering with a re-arm band (a schmitt trigger). It MUST be a strict no-op when `0`:
an edge scent fires on every observed trigger-side transition of its condition, exactly
as if hysteresis were not configured. It MUST be ignored for `level` mode, where
cooldown alone governs repeat firing.

When `hysteresis > 0`, each edge scent carries an armed flag, initially armed
(re-registering the same `scent_id` MUST reset it to armed):

- An `edge_rising` scent fires only while its condition is met AND the scent is armed;
  an `edge_falling` scent fires only while its condition is not met AND the scent is
  armed. Either mode disarms on firing.
- While disarmed, the scent MUST NOT fire — even if the condition re-crosses the
  threshold without leaving the band (e.g. met → not met → met for a rising scent
  whose value never dropped below `threshold - hysteresis`).
- While disarmed, the scent re-arms when the condition's evaluated value (the
  aggregated signal, not individual pheromone intensities) has traveled at least
  `hysteresis` beyond the threshold, away from the trigger side:
  - `>` / `>=` thresholds: an `edge_rising` scent re-arms when
    `value <= threshold - hysteresis`; an `edge_falling` scent re-arms when
    `value >= threshold + hysteresis`.
  - `<` / `<=` thresholds: the bands mirror the above (the trigger side lies below
    the threshold, so the re-arm band lies above it).
- Conditions that expose no numeric threshold (`composite`, `pattern`, `trace`) and
  equality operators (`==`, `!=`) have no meaningful band; hysteresis degrades to
  plain edge semantics: the scent re-arms on the first evaluation observing the
  opposite condition state (not met for rising, met for falling).

The re-arm test is an inequality on the value observed at each evaluation, not path
tracking: a value that jumps across the entire band between evaluations satisfies the
check at its observed endpoint. Once re-armed, the scent fires on the next trigger-side
edge as usual. Hysteresis composes with cooldown: during cooldown the scent is not
evaluated at all (§7.2), so re-arm observations resume only after cooldown expires.

### 7.5 Trace Conditions

Scent conditions MAY reference trace state in addition to pheromone state. This enables cross-layer triggers that combine real-time signals with durable knowledge.

```typescript
interface TraceCondition {
  type: "trace";
  trail: string;
  key: string;           // Use "*" for wildcard (any key in trail)
  operator: "exists" | "not_exists" | "value_eq" | "value_neq";
  field?: string;        // Dot-separated path for value comparison
  expected?: unknown;    // Expected value for value_eq / value_neq
}
```

**Operators:**

| Operator | Returns true when |
|----------|-------------------|
| `exists` | A trace with the given trail+key is present |
| `not_exists` | No trace with the given trail+key is present |
| `value_eq` | The trace's `field` path equals `expected` |
| `value_neq` | The trace's `field` path differs from `expected` |

**Cross-layer example** — trigger when volatility is high AND risk config exists:

```json
{
  "type": "composite",
  "operator": "and",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "threshold",
      "trail": "market",
      "signal_type": "volatility",
      "aggregation": "max",
      "operator": ">=",
      "value": 0.7
    },
    {
      "type": "trace",
      "trail": "config",
      "key": "risk-tolerance",
      "operator": "exists"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 8. Agent Lifecycle

### 8.1 Dormant by Default

Agents SHOULD have no persistent running state. They exist as:
- A registered scent (condition + endpoint)
- Handler code waiting for invocation

### 8.2 Activation Flow

### 8.3 Agent Response

After processing, an agent MAY:
- EMIT new pheromones (continue the stigmergic chain)
- Perform external actions (side effects)
- Return a result (for logging/observability)

Agents SHOULD NOT:
- Maintain state between activations
- Assume previous activation context
- Directly invoke other agents

### 8.4 Activation Timeout

Triggers SHOULD include `max_execution_ms`. If omitted, the default is `120000` ms (120 seconds). If an agent exceeds this, the blackboard:
- MUST mark the activation as timed out
- MAY emit a `system.errors/agent_timeout` pheromone

---

## 9. Wire Protocol

SBP uses **Streamable HTTP** as its primary transport, following the same patterns as MCP (Model Context Protocol). This uses HTTP POST for client-to-server messages and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for server-to-client streaming.

### 9.1 Streamable HTTP Transport

The server provides a single HTTP endpoint (the **SBP endpoint**) that supports both POST and GET methods. For example: `https://example.com/sbp`

#### 9.1.1 Sending Messages to the Server (POST)

All client-to-server messages (EMIT, SNIFF, REGISTER_SCENT, etc.) use HTTP POST:

1. The client **MUST** use HTTP POST to send JSON-RPC messages to the SBP endpoint.
2. The client **MUST** include an `Accept` header listing both `application/json` and `text/event-stream`.
3. The body **MUST** be a single JSON-RPC request or notification.
4. The server **MUST** respond with either:
   - `Content-Type: application/json` for a single JSON response, OR
   - `Content-Type: text/event-stream` to initiate an SSE stream

```
POST /sbp HTTP/1.1
Host: blackboard.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json, text/event-stream
Sbp-Session-Id: abc123
Sbp-Protocol-Version: 0.1

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-1",
  "method": "sbp/emit",
  "params": { "trail": "signals", "type": "event", "intensity": 0.8 }
}
```

#### 9.1.2 Listening for Triggers (GET + SSE)

To receive triggers from the blackboard, clients open an SSE stream:

1. The client **MUST** issue an HTTP GET to the SBP endpoint.
2. The client **MUST** include `Accept: text/event-stream` header.
3. The server **MUST** respond with `Content-Type: text/event-stream`.
4. The server sends JSON-RPC notifications as SSE events when scent conditions are met.

```
GET /sbp HTTP/1.1
Host: blackboard.example.com
Accept: text/event-stream
Sbp-Session-Id: abc123
Sbp-Protocol-Version: 0.1
```

**SSE Response Stream:**
```
event: message
id: evt-001
data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"sbp/trigger","params":{"scent_id":"crisis-detector","triggered_at":1707350400000,"context_pheromones":[...]}}

event: message
id: evt-002
data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"sbp/trigger","params":{"scent_id":"task-ready","triggered_at":1707350500000,"context_pheromones":[...]}}
```

#### 9.1.3 SSE Event Format

Each SSE event contains:
- `event`: Always `"message"` for JSON-RPC messages
- `id`: Unique event ID for resumability (optional but recommended)
- `data`: JSON-RPC notification or request

#### 9.1.4 Resumability

To support reconnection after network interruption:

1. Servers **SHOULD** attach an `id` field to SSE events.
2. Clients **MAY** include `Last-Event-ID` header when reconnecting.
3. Servers **MAY** replay missed events based on the last event ID.

### 9.2 Session Management

1. The server **MAY** assign a session ID during the first request by including `Sbp-Session-Id` in the response header.
2. Clients **MUST** include `Sbp-Session-Id` in all subsequent requests.
3. The server **MAY** return HTTP 404 to indicate an expired session.

### 9.3 Message Format

SBP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 as its message envelope.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-123",
  "method": "sbp/emit",
  "params": { ... }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-123",
  "result": { ... }
}
```

**Error:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-123",
  "error": {
    "code": -32001,
    "message": "Trail not found",
    "data": { "trail": "unknown.trail" }
  }
}
```

**Notification (no response expected):**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "sbp/trigger",
  "params": { ... }
}
```

### 9.4 Protocol Flow

### 9.5 Error Codes

| Code | Message | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| -32700 | Parse error | Invalid JSON |
| -32600 | Invalid request | Not valid JSON-RPC |
| -32601 | Method not found | Unknown SBP method |
| -32602 | Invalid params | Parameter validation failed |
| -32001 | Trail not found | Referenced trail doesn't exist |
| -32002 | Scent not found | Referenced scent doesn't exist |
| -32003 | Payload validation failed | Payload doesn't match trail schema |
| -32004 | Rate limited | Too many requests |
| -32005 | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid credentials |

### 9.6 Required Headers

| Header | Direction | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | Both | `application/json` for POST body, `text/event-stream` for SSE |
| `Accept` | Request | `application/json, text/event-stream` |
| `Sbp-Protocol-Version` | Request | Protocol version (e.g., `0.1`) |
| `Sbp-Session-Id` | Both | Session identifier (after initial request) |
| `Sbp-Agent-Id` | Request | Agent identifier (optional) |
| `Last-Event-ID` | Request | Last received SSE event ID (for resumability) |

### 9.7 Alternative Transports

While Streamable HTTP is the standard transport, implementations MAY also support:

- **stdio**: For subprocess-based communication (like MCP)
- **Unix Domain Socket**: For local same-machine communication

Custom transports MUST preserve JSON-RPC message format and protocol semantics.

---

## 10. Namespacing

### 10.1 Trail Names

Trail names SHOULD follow reverse-domain notation:
```
<domain>.<category>[.<subcategory>...]

Examples:
  market.signals
  market.orders.large
  system.health
  trading.strategy.momentum
```

### 10.2 Reserved Namespaces

| Prefix | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `system.*` | Blackboard internals (health, errors, metrics) |
| `sbp.*` | Protocol-level signals |
| `_*` | Implementation-specific internals |

### 10.3 Signal Types

Within a trail, signal types are simple identifiers:
```
volatility
large_order
heartbeat
error
```

Full signal address: `trail/type` (e.g., `market.signals/volatility`)

---

## 11. Security Considerations

### 11.1 Authentication

Implementations MUST support:
- API keys for agent identification
- Mutual TLS for transport security

Implementations SHOULD support:
- JWT tokens with scoped permissions
- OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow

### 11.2 Authorization

Implementations SHOULD support fine-grained permissions on:
- Trails (read/write per trail)
- Operations (emit/sniff/register)
- Intensity limits (prevent signal flooding)

Example permission structure:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "market-analyzer",
  "permissions": [
    { "trail": "market.*", "operations": ["emit", "sniff"] },
    { "trail": "system.*", "operations": ["sniff"] }
  ],
  "rate_limits": {
    "emit_per_second": 100,
    "max_intensity_per_emit": 1.0
  }
}
```

### 11.3 Payload Security

- Payloads MUST NOT contain secrets
- Sensitive data SHOULD be references (IDs) not values
- Implementations MAY encrypt payloads at rest

### 11.4 Denial of Service

Implementations MUST protect against:
- Signal flooding (rate limits)
- Intensity bombing (max intensity caps)
- Scent explosion (max registrations per agent)
- Evaluation storms (minimum evaluation interval)

---

## 12. Implementation Guidelines

### 12.1 Minimum Viable Implementation

A conformant SBP implementation MUST support:
- EMIT with exponential decay
- SNIFF with intensity filtering
- REGISTER_SCENT with threshold conditions
- TRIGGER delivery

### 12.2 Recommended Architecture

```

### 12.3 Storage Considerations

**In-Memory** (recommended for most cases):
- Fastest intensity computation
- Natural garbage collection of evaporated pheromones
- Lost on restart (acceptable for ephemeral signals)

**Persistent** (for audit/replay):
- Store emission events, not current state
- Rebuild state by replaying with decay computation
- Enables time-travel debugging

### 12.4 Scaling

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Partition by trail
- Scent evaluation is trail-local
- Cross-trail conditions require coordination

**Clock Synchronization:**
- Use logical clocks for ordering
- Physical time only for decay computation
- NTP synchronization between nodes

### 12.5 Observability

Implementations SHOULD emit to `system.metrics`:
- `blackboard_active_pheromones` (gauge)
- `blackboard_emit_rate` (counter)
- `blackboard_trigger_rate` (counter)
- `blackboard_evaluation_latency` (histogram)

## Appendix A: Example Scenarios

### A.1 Market Volatility Response

```python
# Market Analyzer Agent emits volatility signal
await blackboard.emit(
    trail="market.signals",
    type="volatility",
    intensity=0.8,
    decay={"type": "exponential", "half_life_ms": 300000},
    payload={"symbol": "BTC-USD", "vix": 45.2}
)

# Order Monitor Agent emits large order signals
await blackboard.emit(
    trail="market.orders",
    type="large_order",
    intensity=0.6,
    payload={"symbol": "BTC-USD", "size": 1000000, "side": "sell"}
)

# Crisis Handler Agent has registered scent:
# "volatility >= 0.7 AND large_order count >= 3"
# → Automatically triggered when conditions met
```

### A.2 Task Coordination

```python
# Worker agent completes subtask, emits completion signal
await blackboard.emit(
    trail="pipeline.stage1",
    type="completed",
    intensity=1.0,
    decay={"type": "exponential", "half_life_ms": 600000},
    payload={"batch_id": "batch-123", "records": 1000}
)

# Aggregator agent's scent: "stage1/completed count >= 5"
# → Triggered when enough workers complete
# → Reads all completion pheromones for full context
# → Emits stage2 trigger
```

### A.3 Self-Healing System

```python
# Health monitor emits degraded service signal
await blackboard.emit(
    trail="system.health",
    type="degraded",
    intensity=0.9,
    decay={"type": "exponential", "half_life_ms": 60000},
    payload={"service": "payment-api", "error_rate": 0.15}
)

# If not reinforced, signal decays quickly
# If problem persists, continuous reinforcement maintains intensity

# Remediation agent's scent: "degraded >= 0.5 for 30 seconds"
# → Only triggers for persistent issues
# → Transient blips evaporate harmlessly
```
